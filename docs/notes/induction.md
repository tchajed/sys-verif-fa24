# Lecture 3: Induction

> Follow these notes in Coq at [src/sys_verif/coq/induction.v](https://github.com/tchajed/sys-verif-fa24-proofs/blob/main/src/sys_verif/coq/induction.v).

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to

1. Prove theorems about `nat`s with induction
2. Translate informal proof to tactics

## Logistics

Make sure you have keyboard shortcuts working. The essential command is "Coq: Interpret to Point", but it's sometimes useful to also have "Coq: Step Forward" and "Coq: Step Backward".

## Review exercise: safe vs unsafe tactics (part 1)

Recall some tactics we saw last lecture:

- `intros`
- `reflexivity`
- `rewrite`
- `simpl`
- `exists` (provides a witness when the goal is `exists (x: T), P x`)

Define an **safe tactic** as one that if the goal is true, creates only true goals. Define an **unsafe** tactic as a not safe tactic (bonus question: can you rephrase that without the negation?)

Which of the above tactics are safe? Why?

## Proofs about recursive functions

```coq
Module NatDefs.
  (* copy of standard library nat and `Nat.add` (typically written x + y) *)
  Inductive nat : Type :=
  | O
  | S (n: nat).

  Fixpoint add (n1: nat) (n2: nat) : nat :=
    match n1 with
    | O => n2
    (* notice _shadowing_ of [n1] *)
    | S n1 => S (add n1 n2)
    end.
End NatDefs.

```

We'll go back to using the standard library definitions for the rest of the file.

```coq
Module MoreNatProofs.

Lemma add_0_l n :
  0 + n = n.
Proof.
  simpl. (* Works because [add] pattern matches on the first argument. *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.

```

The above proof is a "proof by computation" which followed from the definition of `add`. The reverse doesn't follow from just computation: `add` pattern matches on `n`, but it's a variable. Instead, we need to prove this by induction:

```coq
(** This will generally be set for you in this class. It enforces structured
proofs, requiring a bullet ([-], [+], and [*] in Ltac) or curly brace when
there's more than one subgoal.
*)
Set Default Goal Selector "!".

Lemma add_0_r_failed n :
  n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  destruct n as [|n].
  - simpl.
    reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    (* do this again?? *)
    destruct n as [|n].
Abort.

```

Recall the _principle of induction_: if $P$ is some property of natural numbers and we want to prove $\forall n, P(n)$, then we can do the proof as follows:

- **base case:** show that $P(0)$ is true
- **inductive step:** for any $n'$, assume $P(n')$ and prove $P(1 + n')$.

From these two we conclude exactly what we wanted: $\forall n, P(n)$.

This is exactly what we can do with the `induction` tactic. What Coq will do for us is infer the property of `n` we're proving based on the goal.

```coq
Lemma add_0_r n :
  n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  induction n as [|n IHn].
  - (* base case *)
    simpl.
    reflexivity.
  - (* inductve step, with [IHn] as the inductive hypothesis *)
    simpl.
    rewrite IHn.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

```

We'll now go through some "propositional" proofs that follow from the rules for manipulating logical AND (`∧`) and OR (`∨`).

First, let's just recall the rules with toy examples. In these examples, `P`, `Q`, `R` will be used as arbitrary "propositions" - for the intuition it's sufficient to think of these as boolean-valued facts that can be true or false. They would be things like `n = 3` or `n < m`. The reason they aren't booleans in Coq is a deep theoretical one we won't worry about.

```coq
Lemma or_intro_r (P Q R: Prop) :
  Q -> P \/ Q.
Proof.
  intros HQ.

```

Pick the right disjunct to prove. Similarly, `left` would leave use to prove `P`.

```coq
  right.
  assumption.
Qed.

Lemma or_elim (P Q R: Prop) :
  (P -> R) ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  (P \/ Q) -> R.
Proof.
  intros HR1 HR2 H.

```

`destruct` on H, which is an `∨`, leaves us with two goals: why? what are they?

```coq
  destruct H as [HP | HQ].
```

:::: info Goals

```txt title="goal 1"
  P, Q, R : Prop
  HR1 : P -> R
  HR2 : Q -> R
  HP : P
  ============================
  R
```

```txt title="goal 2"
  P, Q, R : Prop
  HR1 : P -> R
  HR2 : Q -> R
  HQ : Q
  ============================
  R
```

::::

```coq
  - apply (HR1 HP).
  - apply (HR2 HQ).
Qed.

Lemma and_intro P Q :
  P ->
  Q ->
  P /\ Q.
Proof.
  intros HP HQ.

```

`split` turns a proof of A ∧ B into two separate goals

```coq
  split.
```

:::: info Goals

```txt title="goal 1"
  P, Q : Prop
  HP : P
  HQ : Q
  ============================
  P
```

```txt title="goal 2"
  P, Q : Prop
  HP : P
  HQ : Q
  ============================
  Q
```

::::

```coq
  - assumption.
  - assumption.
Qed.

Lemma and_elim_r P Q :
  (P /\ Q) -> Q.
Proof.
  intros H.

```

`destruct` on an `∧` has a very different effect - why?

```coq
  destruct H as [HP HQ]. (* {GOALS DIFF} *)
  apply HQ.
Qed.

```

### Proof trees

On board: we can visualize the effect of each of these strategies as a _proof tree_.

### Back to nat

```coq
Lemma O_or_succ n :
  n = 0 \/ n = S (Nat.pred n).
Proof.
  destruct n as [ | n']. (** Make a case distinction on [n]. *)
  - (** Case [n = 0] *)
    left.
    reflexivity.
  - (** Case [n = S n'] *)
    right.
    simpl. (** [pred (S n')] simplifies to [n']. *)
    reflexivity.
Qed.

```

This proof uses `intros` and `rewrite`.

Coq allows you to write `intros` without arguments, in which case it will automatically select names. We strongly recommend in this class to always give names, since it makes your proof easier to read and modify, as well as making it easier to read the context while you're developing a proof.

```coq
Lemma eq_add_O_2 n m :
  n = 0 -> m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  (** The goal is an implication, and we can "introduce" an hypothesis with the
  [intros] tactic - notice the effect on the goal *)
  intros Hn.
```

:::: info Goal diff

```txt title="goal diff"
  n, m : nat
  Hn : n = 0 // [!code ++]
  ============================
  n = 0 -> m = 0 -> n + m = 0 // [!code --]
  m = 0 -> n + m = 0 // [!code ++]
```

::::

```coq
  intros Hm.


```

`rewrite` is another fundamental proof technique

```coq
  rewrite Hn.
```

:::: info Goal diff

```txt title="goal diff"
  n, m : nat
  Hn : n = 0
  Hm : m = 0
  ============================
  n + m = 0 // [!code --]
  0 + m = 0 // [!code ++]
```

::::

```coq
  rewrite Hm.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

```

This lemma is a proof of a disequality, a "not equals". Even this isn't built-in to Coq but built from simpler primitives.

```coq
Lemma neq_succ_0 n :
  S n <> 0.
Proof.
  (* Wade through the sea of notation *)
  Locate "<>".
```

:::: note Output

```txt title="coq output"
Notation "x <> y  :> T" := (not (eq x y)) : type_scope
  (default interpretation)
Notation "x <> y" := (not (eq x y)) : type_scope (default interpretation)
```

```coq
  Locate "~".
```

::::

```coq
  (** We see that [a <> b] is notation for [not (a = b)], which is by definition
  [a = b -> False]. *)

  unfold not.

  (** Since our goal is an implication, we use [intros]: *)
  intros Hn.

  (** It is impossible for [S ...] to be equal to [0], we can thus derive
  anything, including [False], which is otherwise never provable. The
  [discriminate] tactic looks for an impossible equality and solves any goal by
  contradiction. *)
  discriminate.
Qed.

Lemma succ_pred n : n <> 0 -> n = S (Nat.pred n).
Proof.
  intros Hn.
  destruct (O_or_succ n) as [H0|HS].
  - unfold not in Hn.
    (* There are a few different ways to proceed. Here's one: *)
    exfalso. (* [exfalso] encodes the strategy of proving [False] from the
    current hypotheses, from which the original conclusion follows (regardless
    of what it is). *)
    apply Hn.
    assumption.
  - assumption.
Qed.

```

Here's a toy example to illustrate what using and proving with AND looks like.

```coq
Lemma and_or_example (P Q: Prop) :
  (P /\ Q) \/ (Q /\ P) -> P /\ Q.
Proof.
  intros H.
  destruct H as [H | H].
  - assumption.
  - destruct H as [HQ HP].
    split.
    + assumption.
    + assumption.
Qed.

Lemma add_O_iff n m :
  (n = 0 /\ m = 0) <-> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  Locate "<->".
```

:::: note Output

```txt title="coq output"
Notation "A <-> B" := (iff A B) : type_scope (default interpretation)
```

::::

```coq
  unfold iff.
  split.
  - intros [Hn Hm].
    subst.
    reflexivity.
  - intros H.
    destruct n as [|n].
    + rewrite add_0_l in H.
      split.
      { reflexivity. }
      assumption.
    + simpl in H.
      (* in the rest of this class, more commonly [congruence] *)
      discriminate.
Qed.

```

You can see the use of bullets `-` and `+` to structure the proof above. You can also use `{ ... }` (used once above), which are often preferred if the proof of the first subgoal is small compared to the rest of the proof (such as the single-line `{ reflexivity. }` above).

```coq
Lemma add_comm n1 n2 :
  n1 + n2 = n2 + n1.
Proof.
  induction n1 as [|n1 IHn].
  - simpl.

```

An important part of your job in constructing both the informal and formal proof is to think about how previously proven (by you or someone else) lemmas might help you. In this case we did this part of the proof above.

```coq
    rewrite add_0_r.
    reflexivity.
  - simpl.
```

:::: info Goal

```txt title="goal 1"
  n1, n2 : nat
  IHn : n1 + n2 = n2 + n1
  ============================
  S (n1 + n2) = n2 + S n1
```

::::

## Exercise: what lemma to prove?

```coq
Abort.



```

Think before looking ahead.

```coq
Lemma add_succ_r n1 n2 :
  n1 + S n2 = S (n1 + n2).
Proof.
  induction n1 as [|n1 IH].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IH. reflexivity.
Qed.

Lemma add_comm n1 n2 :
  n1 + n2 = n2 + n1.
Proof.
  induction n1 as [|n1 IHn].
  - simpl.

```

An important part of your job in constructing both the informal and formal proof is to think about how previously proven (by you or someone else) lemmas might help you. In this case we did this part of the proof above.

```coq
    rewrite add_0_r.
    reflexivity.
  - simpl.
    rewrite add_succ_r. (* now go use the lemma we factored out *)
    rewrite IHn.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

End MoreNatProofs.

## Option monad

This section introduces two more core features of functional programming: polymorphic types (also called "generics" in other languages) and "higher-order functions" (functions that take other functions as parameters).

```coq
Module Option.


```

`option` is a polymorphic type: it takes a type `A` as an argument, and (maybe) contains a value of that arbitrary type. `option A` is the simplest "container" type.

```coq
  Inductive option (A: Type) :=
  | Some (x: A)
  | None.


```

Here are some functions you can define on `option`. There are good motivations for _why_ you should define these particular ones, but we won't get into that (and it isn't all that important for this class). For now, just try to understand the behavior. `map` runs `f` "inside" the optional value.

```coq
  Definition map {A B} (ma: option A) (f: A -> B) : option B :=
    match ma with
    | Some _ x => Some B (f x)
    | None _ => None B
    end.


```

`Some` and `None` take an extra type argument `A: Type` that comes from the inductive definition. You'll notice we supply an `_` in the pattern match; this is because that argument is fixed to be `A` based on the type of `ma` and can't actually be pattern matched on. To make it easier to work with polymorphic functions, Coq has a feature called _implicit arguments_. These commands modify how type inference treats `Some` and `None`, making the type argument implicit (that's what the curly braces mean). Don't worry about the syntax; you won't need to do this yourself. Ordinarily we would do this setup right after defining the type, but for illustration we first wrote `map`.

```coq
  Arguments Some {A} x.
  Arguments None {A}.


```

Now we can just supply the element to `Some` and let type inference figure out what type it should produce:

```coq
  Definition some_ex : option nat := Some 3.

```

Even this works, using the annotation `option nat` to figure out what type to pass to `None`.

```coq
  Definition none_ex : option nat := None.


```

It is also possible to pass the type arguments if needed. `@None` is just like `None` but with all implicit arguments made explicit:

```coq
  Definition none_ex_2 := @None nat.


```

We'll now define `return_` (it should be called `return` but that's a Coq keyword) and `bind`. These make `option` into a _Monad_ but you don't need to understand that, just read the definitions.

```coq
  Definition return_ {A} (x: A) : option A := Some x.

  Definition bind {A B} (ma: option A) (f: A -> option B) : option B :=
    match ma with
    | Some x => f x
    | None => None
    end.


```

These are some properties of `return_` and `bind` (again, good reason for these but not relevant here).

```coq
  Lemma return_left_id {A B} (x: A) (f: A -> option B) :
    bind (return_ x) f = f x.
  Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

  Lemma return_right_id {A} (ma: option A) :
    bind ma return_ = ma.
  Proof. destruct ma; reflexivity. Qed.

  Lemma bind_assoc {A B C} (ma: option A) (f: A -> option B) (g: B -> option C) :
    bind (bind ma f) g = bind ma (fun x => bind (f x) g).
  Proof. destruct ma; reflexivity. Qed.

End Option.
```
